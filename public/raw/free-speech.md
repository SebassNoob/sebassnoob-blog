When it comes to human rights, one of them rooted deep in the mantle of many societies is that of free speech. Thoughout the winding road of history, there has been many times where the right to protest, to fight for a cause, to raise awareness, has been the main driving force for societal development.

## The driving force

Once upon a time, marginalised voices were silent. Not because they wanted to, but because they _had to_.

In the past century alone, there has been much progress in feminism and women's rights sphere. Back then, expression of ideas and opinions were limited for many women. Many wives were told to 'stay in the kitchen!', or 'go iron the clothes!' by their husbands for simply daring to speak out, to express themselves and their ideas. Obviously, this was not healthy for society -- resulting in the first ripples of the [feminist movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-wave_feminism). This laid the groundwork for the feminist movements that followed, with women like the suffragettes and activists at the [Seneca Falls Convention](https://www.history.com/topics/womens-history/seneca-falls-convention) taking bold, visible steps toward equality. Protests broke out, pressuring politicians to make a change. And changes they did make! Autonomy and collective representation were granted to all women for the first time in history, representing a paradigm step forward for the freedom of expression as a right.

To cite an example from the [Scientific Revolution](https://www.britannica.com/question/What-is-the-Scientific-Revolution), a time of great progress toward the Enlightenment, Galileo Galilei's support for heliocentrism - the viewpoint that the Earth is orbiting the Sun, and not the other way around - landed him in hot water. His work and proof of this model was met with silencing by the Church -- believing that heliocentrism was heresy. Assembled theologians struck down his rigourous defence of the theory, deeming it dangerous and going against the Bible. But Galileo was right. It was his free expression, although limited by the institutions of the time, that pushed forth the _unstoppable_ motion of the Scientific Revolution, leading to the great popularisation of science.

## Differences in global freedoms with respect to speech

Times have gotten _a lot_ better for many people worldwide. Yet, even to this day, some still remain shackled under the chains of censorship.

The most stark example is that of the 2 Koreas. Toward the north lies a totalitatian dictatorship where those who speak out are silenced permanently. Toward the south, those who express themselves not only get away without consequence, but also foster a nationwide movement, drawing attention to their cause.

The recent [medical crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_South_Korean_medical_crisis) demonstrates the overwhelming power of free speech in the south. Although I may not agree with the protest's motive—to limit the training of new doctors to protect current wages—the fact that the South Korean government permits such outspoken demonstrations underscores the value it places on free speech. It is readily apparent that free speech as a notion and a right in this country is oh-so-important -- where doctors fight for their salary to support themselves and their families by exercising their rights.

On the other side of the border, a whole other reality exists. Shrouded in nation-wide media censors -- it is no secret that free speech is [repressed and tossed aside](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights_in_North_Korea#Freedom_of_speech_and_assembly) in favour of 'national unity' and 'party loyalty' in the hermit kingdom. Criticism of the regime is strictly prohibited, even in private, and doing so can land one's family and themself in a 're-education' - or rather a concentration - camp. Arbitrary arrests, denial of human rights, and torture are all common responses to any form of free speech in North Korea. Today, despite the freedom of speech in the south, their northern brethren are still chained up, mouths taped shut by the regime -- a stark contrast despite their proximity.

## The rights of the next generation

The lack of freedom of speech today still binds the hands of many. And the current trends of the world seem to point toward an increasing number of 'bound' people.

From the [arrest](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/sep/23/telegram-illegal-content-pavel-durov-arrest) of Telegram's CEO in France for the lack of moderation on the social media platform, to the [banning](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/sep/23/telegram-illegal-content-pavel-durov-arrest) of harmful books in US schools, to a potential [ban](https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/x-faces-potential-sanctions-in-the-uk-over-musks-protest-comments/723531/) of X (formerly Twitter) in the UK -- the list of restrictions on free speech keeps on growing.

This isn't to downplay the risks of hate speech that inevitably comes along with free speech. But the future does seem grim for many free speech proponents worldwide. With the rise of the far right in western political systems who seek to impose more regulations with regard to which kinds of media conflict with their traditional values, free speech is now on the downtrend -- a big step backward from the liberalisation of free speech in the 20th century.

While nobody can predict the future, control over speech seems to be the way to go from here on out. I fear that the new generation will step into a world where speech is limited, rights are curtailed and protests ignored. As members of our society, and of the global community, we must stop this trend both at home and at the ballot box. If not, maybe we don't deserve our hard-earned rights.
