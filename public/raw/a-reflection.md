I recently just graduated [Junior College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junior_college_(Singapore)) (JC) in Singapore. As I personally reflect on my experiences in the education system up until now, I'd like to share some thoughts on them.

## Chasing that last mark

It's not like grades are completely unimportant. However, every student's eternal chase for that last point to the next grade boundary, that last 1 mark on the arbitrarily important test, is unhealthy, to put it lightly. Perhaps that student was just unlucky on the test. Or had a headache on test day. There are so many external factors that can influence one's grade, and when grade boundaries are [defined so strictly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_grading_in_Singapore) that there must be no room for error, it leads to a system in which 1 missed mark can derail one's future. The flaw here is obvious. Students, who of no fault of their own, suffer mentally under this system which prioritises grades over everything else. And when the line is so thin to cross from 1 letter grade to the next, undue stress is inflicted.

I still remember my hyper-competitive self back in primary school. Family, friends and teachers commented phrases like 'Oh, you score so well!', and me being my childhood self, I drank it in like a drowning man grasping for straws. I was an asshole desperate for affirmation, to put it crudely. And when I missed the top spot on a test by a handful of points, I was told 'What happened? Why didn't you do better?'. Young me blamed myself over and over again for missing a careless mistake that anyone could have made under exam pressure. My mental health was terrible back then. And for what? Those few marks, combined with burnout, costed me a place in my dream secondary school. Even though it hardly matters now, why was the system like this in the first place?

## Degradation of knowledge post-graduation

At the time of writing, it's been several months since I've last encountered my JC subjects. The common consensus among my peers is that we've all forgotten the content we've learned and committed to memory then.

All the economics graphs, quantum physics concepts, mathematical theorems that I've spent the majority of my waking hours learning over the last 2 years have melted away from my long-term memory by now. What's left is the shell of them -- the memories of nights long gone, spent grinding away at tutorial questions, formatting notes and practicing with mock tests. It was all a means to an end -- only that A level certificate mattered. It's not like the [photoelectric effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoelectric_effect) or the [complex conjuate root theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_conjugate_root_theorem) _really_ matter to me (or to anyone else). If myself (and seemingly the rest of my peers) have all forgotten the content knowledge we used for the exams, what was the point of learning it in the first place?

## A frustrated conclusion

My education wasn't all bad. I made friends, embarked on new experiences, and had shared experiences with the rest of my cohort. 

At the end of the day, one's past grades and content knowledge don't matter in the long run. Changes are beginning to be made to make the education system here less stressful and more forgiving. All that matters now is looking ahead to the future and writing one's own unique story.
